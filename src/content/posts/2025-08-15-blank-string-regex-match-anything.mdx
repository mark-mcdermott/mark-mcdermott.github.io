A saw an interesting regex but today that I hadn't ever thought about before. A regex that is an empty string will match all values. That's because it will always say that it did indeed find "" in the string.

## Example: Expected Case

```
const env = {
	AUTH_API_URL: "auth.example.com"
};

const regex = new RegExp(env.AUTH_API_URL || "");

const urls = [
"https://google.com",
"https://auth.example.com/login",
"https://facebook.com"
];

let result = `AUTH_API_URL = "${env.AUTH_API_URL}"\n\n`;
result += `RegExp source: ${regex}\n\n`;

urls.forEach(url => {
	result += `${url} => ${regex.test(url)}\n`;
});

document.getElementById("output").textContent = result;
```

which outputs this:
```
AUTH_API_URL = "auth.example.com"

RegExp source: /auth.example.com/

https://google.com => false
https://auth.example.com/login => true
https://facebook.com => false
```

In the expected case, `env.AUTH_API_URL` is set so the blank string fallback is not used. And the results are as we'd expect: `auth.example.com/login` has a match with `/auth.example.com/`, but `google.com` and `facebook.com` do not.
## Example: Unexpected Case

```
const env = { };

const regex = new RegExp(env.AUTH_API_URL || "");

const urls = [
"https://google.com",
"https://auth.example.com/login",
"https://facebook.com"
];

let result = `AUTH_API_URL = "${env.AUTH_API_URL}"\n\n`;
result += `RegExp source: ${regex}\n\n`;

urls.forEach(url => {
	result += `${url} => ${regex.test(url)}\n`;
});

document.getElementById("output").textContent = result;
```

which outputs this:
```
AUTH_API_URL = "undefined"

RegExp source: /(?:)/

https://google.com => true
https://auth.example.com/login => true
https://facebook.com => true
```

In the unexpected case, `env.AUTH_API_URL` is not set, so the blank string fallback is used. And the results are not what I expected: `auth.example.com/login`, `google.com` and `facebook.com` all have matches with `/auth.example.com/`! That's because they all all have "" in them. ðŸ˜¬
