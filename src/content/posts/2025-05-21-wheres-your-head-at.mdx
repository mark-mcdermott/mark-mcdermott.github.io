Another day, another realization that I still have a lot to learn in Git. Today's medium-dive: understanding how changes on a development branch compare to main.

## Precondition
- First grab latest remote changes:
  ```
  git fetch origin
  ```

## Local Branch Vs Tracking Branch
- This is the easy one. `git status` says if you're ahead/behind your remote tracking branch (e.g. `origin/testbranch`).

## Changes Vs Local Master

### Number of Commits Ahead/Behind Local Master
- This is one seems almost random, but this outputs how many commits your `HEAD` is behind (first number) and ahead (second number) of local master`.
```
git rev-list --left-right --count master...HEAD
```

### Visual of the Commits Ahead/Behind Local Master
- `git log --oneline --graph --decorate master..HEAD`    # commits ahead
- `git log --oneline --graph --decorate HEAD..master`    # commits behind

### Number of Commits Ahead/Behing Local Master in Plain English
```
git rev-list --left-right --count master...HEAD | awk '{print "Behind by "$1" commits, ahead by "$2" commits."}'
```

## Changes Vs Remote Master

### Number of Commits Ahead/Behind Remote Master
```
git rev-list --left-right --count origin/master...HEAD
```

### Visual of the Commits Ahead/Behind Remote Master
- `git log --oneline --graph --decorate origin/master..HEAD`    # commits ahead
- `git log --oneline --graph --decorate HEAD..origin/master`    # commits behind


### Number of Commits Ahead/Behind Remote Master In Plain English
```
git fetch origin && git rev-list --left-right --count origin/master...HEAD | awk '{print "Behind by "$1" commits, ahead by "$2" commits."}'
```

## Misc Helpful stuff

- see which upstream your current branch tracks (and ahead/behind vs upstream)
```
git branch -vv
```
- ensure local master matches the remote (optional)
```
git checkout master
git fetch origin
git pull --ff-only   # or: git reset --hard origin/master
```
