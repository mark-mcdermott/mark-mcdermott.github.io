I've been learning Docker lately and learned a few new things last night: how to access a shell in a running container and how to copy files to and from a container.

## Access Shell in Container
`docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> sh`

- `exec` runs a command inside a container
- `-i` is for "interactive" mode
- `-t` is for "teletype", i.e. a shell
- a container will have an id by default, something like `e4ef2fab0a5d`. You can get the id by running `docker ps`.
- you can give a container a name if you want when creating it with `docker run --name <custom_name> <image>`
- `sh` is the shell you want to run. You can also use `bash` or `zsh` if they're installed in the container.

## Copy File from Container
`docker cp <container_name_or_id>:<path_in_container> <path_on_host>`
- `cp` is "copy"

## Copy File to Container
`docker cp <path_on_host> <container_name_or_id>:<path_in_container>`
- the is the same as above but the paths are reversed, so the order of the paths is what determines the direction of the copy.
